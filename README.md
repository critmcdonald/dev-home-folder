### A Local Home Page for OSX Web Development

This is a small and simple local home page that automatically lists, and provide links to, your local sites. It's a companion project for a [blog post](http://mallinson.ca/post/osx-web-development) by Chris Mallinson about setting up your Mac for web development.

His version is [available here](http://cmall.github.io/LocalHomePage/).

This one is modified to use `/www/projects/` and `/www/home/`.
